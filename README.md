Open source AI language learning platform available in two modes: self-hosted (free, run it on your own
infrastructure) and as a hosted service operated by the FreeLingo team (paid subscription).
A language model evaluates your CEFR level, generates a personalized study plan, and guides you through
grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, writing lessons, AI-generated listening exercises, and AI-generated reading exercises — with optional voice features.

The study plan follows a CEFR-aligned curriculum (A1-C2) organized into units with
clear competencies and prerequisites. After a deterministic placement assessment,
FreeLingo creates a weekly roadmap based on your selected intensity (4, 8, 12, or
16 weeks), then unlocks lessons in sequence: grammar, vocabulary, reading, writing,
and review.

The platform combines structure and adaptation: lessons are generated within
curriculum boundaries, flashcards use SM-2 spaced repetition, and the AI tutor
provides contextual streaming feedback in English (with optional brief support in
the learner's native language). Listening exercises are generated on demand by the
LLM, synthesised to MP3 via TTS, and cached per CEFR level — the user listens,
answers 5 comprehension questions, and earns XP before the transcript is revealed.
Reading exercises follow the same caching model but without audio — the AI generates
a passage and 5 comprehension questions displayed side by side; the user reads and
answers immediately, earning XP per correct answer.
Progress tracking includes XP, streaks, skill scores, unit competencies, and an
end-of-level completion test.

## Architecture

Monorepo: `backend/` (Python FastAPI) + `frontend/` (Next.js 16 App Router)
deployed via Docker Compose with PostgreSQL 16 and Redis 7.
The backend proxies all external services (Ollama, Kokoro, Whisper) —
the frontend never calls them directly.

## Quick start

### Option A — Git clone + Docker Compose

**Requirements:** Docker, Docker Compose, Git, and [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running on the host.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/artcc/freelingo.git
cd freelingo

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set OLLAMA_BASE_URL, choose your model, and review other settings

# 3. Pull the recommended model (run on the host, not inside Docker)
ollama pull gemma4:e4b

# 4. Start all services (migrations run automatically on first start)
docker compose up -d
```

Access at `http://localhost:3000` (or `http://<server-ip>:3000`).  
The first registered user becomes admin automatically.

---

### Option B — Portainer (Stack)

1. Open Portainer → **Stacks** → **Add stack**.
2. Choose **Repository** and enter the repo URL, or paste the contents of `docker-compose.yml` directly into the Web editor.
3. Scroll down to **Environment variables** and add the variables from `.env.example` (at minimum: `SECRET_KEY`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`).
4. Click **Deploy the stack**.
5. Access the app at `http://<server-ip>:3000`. Database migrations run automatically when the backend starts.

> **Tip:** If Ollama runs on the same host as Portainer, set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434`. On Linux you may need to add the `extra_hosts` entry in the compose file (already included by default).

## Operational notes

- The recommended model for Ollama is `gemma4:e4b`. It can be changed in `.env`.
- The backend acts as a proxy for Ollama/TTS/STT calls so the frontend never talks directly to those services.
- The `LLM_PROVIDER` field controls the LLM provider: `ollama` (local, recommended), `openai`, `anthropic`, or `deepseek`.
- `TTS_PROVIDER` and `STT_PROVIDER` are independent: `local` (Kokoro / faster-whisper) or `openai` (OpenAI API).
- The target language is always **English** (`en-US` American English or `en-GB` British English). The variant is chosen on the `/onboarding` screen immediately after registration. The user's native language is asked during registration and is used only for flashcard translations and tutor feedback.

## Linux host: Redis memory overcommit

Redis requires `vm.overcommit_memory=1` on the host to safely perform background saves (RDB snapshots). Without it, a `fork()` under low memory can fail and Redis may lose data on restart.

Run once on the server:

```bash
sudo sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1
echo "vm.overcommit_memory = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
```

The first command applies the setting immediately (no reboot needed); the second persists it across reboots. This is a host-level setting — it cannot be applied from within the container without elevated privileges.

## Reverse proxy requirement (real-time conversation)

The real-time voice conversation feature uses a WebSocket connection (`/ws/conversation`). Next.js does not proxy WebSocket upgrades natively, so **a reverse proxy is required in any production deployment** to route `/ws/*` traffic to the backend container.

This is also a hard browser requirement: `getUserMedia` (microphone access) only works in a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) — HTTPS or localhost. A reverse proxy terminating TLS is therefore mandatory for the conversation feature to work at all in production.

The WebSocket URL is derived automatically from `window.location`, so no extra configuration is needed on the frontend side — just ensure your reverse proxy forwards `/ws/*` to `backend:8000`.

## Enabling TTS & STT

TTS and STT each support two providers, selected independently via `.env`.

### Provider options

| Variable | Values | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `TTS_PROVIDER` | `local` · `openai` | `local` uses Kokoro-FastAPI; `openai` uses OpenAI TTS API |
| `STT_PROVIDER` | `local` · `openai` | `local` uses faster-whisper; `openai` uses OpenAI Whisper API |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | string | Required for `openai` provider on either service |

When using `openai` providers, the `kokoro` and `whisper` Docker services can be removed from the stack — no local GPU required.

### Option A — Local providers (self-hosted, GPU recommended)

The `kokoro` and `whisper` services in `docker-compose.yml` are pre-configured for NVIDIA GPUs.

```env
TTS_PROVIDER=local
STT_PROVIDER=local
```

The Kokoro image (`ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-gpu`) supports all NVIDIA architectures via two builds: `:latest-cu128` (0.4.0+) for Blackwell/RTX 50-series, and `:latest` for Maxwell through Hopper (confirmed Pascal/GTX 10xx support).

For CPU-only hosts, replace the image tags and remove the `deploy` block in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
kokoro:
  image: ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-cpu:latest
  restart: unless-stopped

whisper:
  image: onerahmet/openai-whisper-asr-webservice:latest
  restart: unless-stopped
  environment:
    - ASR_MODEL=base
    - ASR_ENGINE=faster_whisper
```

> Use `ASR_MODEL=base` or `small` on CPU. Larger models are very slow without a GPU.

#### TTS voice options (Kokoro-82M)

All voices are for English. Grades reflect training data quality and quantity.

| Voice | Gender | Accent | Grade |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| `af_heart` | F | American | A ⭐ |
| `af_bella` | F | American | A- |
| `af_nicole` | F | American | B- |
| `am_fenrir` | M | American | C+ |
| `am_michael` | M | American | C+ |
| `am_puck` | M | American | C+ |
| `bf_emma` | F | British | B- |
| `bm_george` | M | British | C |

Set with `TTS_VOICE=<voice>` in `.env`. Default: `af_heart`.

See the [full list of available voices](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M/blob/main/VOICES.md) on HuggingFace.

#### STT model options (Whisper)

| Model | VRAM | Speed vs large | Notes |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| `tiny.en` | ~1 GB | ~10x | Very low accuracy |
| `small.en` | ~2 GB | ~4x | OK for CPU |
| `medium` | ~5 GB | ~2x | Good balance |
| `large-v3-turbo` | ~6 GB | ~8x | **Recommended** — best speed/accuracy ratio |
| `large-v3` | ~10 GB | 1x | Maximum accuracy |

Set with `STT_MODEL=<model>` in `.env`. Default: `large-v3-turbo`.

| Engine | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `faster_whisper` | **Recommended** — 4× faster than openai_whisper, lower VRAM via CTranslate2 |
| `openai_whisper` | Original PyTorch implementation |
| `whisperx` | Adds speaker diarization; requires HuggingFace token |

Set with `STT_ENGINE=<engine>` in `.env`. Default: `faster_whisper`.

### Option B — OpenAI providers (no local GPU needed)

```env
TTS_PROVIDER=openai
STT_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Uses the same `OPENAI_API_KEY` as the LLM if `LLM_PROVIDER=openai`. No extra services needed.
