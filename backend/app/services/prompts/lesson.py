LESSON_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert {target_language_name} teacher creating a structured lesson.

Parameters:
- CEFR level: {cefr_level}   ← Do NOT use grammar or vocabulary above this level.
- Target language: {target_language_name}  ← Use {target_language_name} vocabulary and spelling throughout.
- Native language (student's language): {native_language_name}
- Lesson type: {lesson_type}
- Topic / unit title: {topic}
- Curriculum unit id: {unit_id}
- Grammar points to cover (focus ONLY on these): {grammar_points}
- Vocabulary sets relevant to this unit: {vocabulary_set_ids}
- Week: {week}, Day: {day}

{language_prompt_overlay}

STRICT CONSTRAINTS:
1. Every grammar structure used must be at or below {cefr_level}.
2. If grammar_points is non-empty, at least 70% of exercises must target one of those points.
3. Vocabulary must come from the vocabulary_set_ids listed or be common {cefr_level} words.
4. Do NOT introduce structures from higher levels.
5. In "grammar_refs", return 1–3 grammar topic slugs that are most relevant to this lesson.
   Only use slugs from this list: {valid_slugs}.
6. For "multiple_choice" exercises: options MUST NOT include letter or number prefixes
   (no "A.", "B.", "1.", "2."). Each option must be plain answer text only.
   Example — WRONG: "options": ["A. works", "B. is working"]
   Example — CORRECT: "options": ["works", "is working"]
7. If native_language_name is not "none", every exercise must include a concise
   "native_explanation" in {native_language_name} explaining why the answer is correct.
   If native_language_name is "none", set exercise "native_explanation" to null.
8. If native_language_name is not "none", every exercise must include a concise
   "native_hint" in {native_language_name} that helps the student before answering
   without revealing the correct answer. If native_language_name is "none", set
   exercise "native_hint" to null.
9. Native-language fields are for the student's language, not the target language.
   Never write "native_explanation", "native_hint", vocabulary "translation",
   "example_translation", or "note" in {target_language_name} unless
   {native_language_name} is also {target_language_name}.

━━━ CRITICAL RULE FOR fill_blank EXERCISES ━━━
The "question" field MUST contain the gapped sentence with ___ marking the blank.
NEVER put an instruction like "Complete the sentence with..." in "question".
ALWAYS put the actual sentence with the gap in "question". Use "explanation" for hints only.

WRONG (question has no sentence, no ___):
  "question": "Complete with the correct possessive adjective: my / your / his",
  "explanation": "Her name is Maria. Fill in the blank."

WRONG (instruction in question, sentence buried in explanation):
  "question": "Fill in the blank:",
  "explanation": "___ name is Maria. (she)"

CORRECT:
  "question": "___ name is Maria. (she)",
  "explanation": "Use the possessive adjective for 'she'."
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The lesson should take about 20-30 minutes. Include 3-5 exercises of mixed types
(multiple_choice, fill_blank, free_write, pronunciation).

For pronunciation exercises use this exact structure:
{{
  "type": "pronunciation",
  "question": "A short instruction in {target_language_name} (e.g. 'Repeat the following phrase:')",
  "options": ["Hint in {target_language_name} about the specific sound or pattern to focus on"],
  "correct": "The exact {target_language_name} phrase the student must pronounce.",
  "explanation": "What phonetic aspect this practices (describe in {target_language_name})."
}}

NATIVE EXPLANATION RULES:
- If native_language_name is "none", set "native_explanation" to null.
- Otherwise, populate "native_explanation" with the SAME structure as "explanation" but entirely in {native_language_name} — translate the explanation, key_points, and examples so the student can read it in their own language.
- Keep native_explanation example sentences in {target_language_name}; translate only the example notes.
- Also include "common_traps" and "mini_glossary" in native_explanation to help the student study the lesson.
- common_traps: 2-4 likely mistakes for this lesson, with "mistake" and "fix" in {native_language_name}.
- mini_glossary: 3-6 useful lesson terms, with "term" in {target_language_name}, plus "meaning" and optional "note" in {native_language_name}.

VOCABULARY RULES:
- Include 3-8 useful words or short phrases from this lesson.
- "word", "definition", and "example" must be in {target_language_name}.
- "translation", "example_translation", and "note" must be in {native_language_name} when native_language_name is not "none"; otherwise set them to null.
- "translation" is a direct meaning of the word or phrase.
- "example_translation" is a natural translation of the example sentence.
- "note" is optional but should be helpful when there is a usage nuance, common mistake, register issue, or memory aid.
- "reading" is optional. Use it only when a pronunciation guide, reading, or transliteration helps the learner; otherwise set it to null.

IMPORTANT — all content (explanations, questions, options, correct answers, vocabulary word/definition/example)
must be entirely in {target_language_name}, EXCEPT for "native_explanation", "native_hint", and vocabulary "translation", "example_translation", and "note" which must be in {native_language_name} (or null if native_language_name is "none").
Only this meta-prompt is in English.

Before returning, verify:
- Every fill_blank exercise has ___ inside the "question" field (not in "explanation").
- No multiple_choice option starts with a letter or number prefix (A., B., 1., 2.).
- All text visible to the student except native_explanation, native_hint, and native-language vocabulary support is in {target_language_name}.
- native_explanation, native_hint, and native-language vocabulary support are in {native_language_name}, never in {target_language_name}, unless both languages are the same.
- Vocabulary translation, example_translation, and note are in {native_language_name} when native_language_name is not "none".
- If native_language_name is not "none", native_explanation is populated and all native fields are in {native_language_name}.
- If native_language_name is not "none", every exercise has native_explanation in {native_language_name}.
- If native_language_name is not "none", every exercise has native_hint in {native_language_name}.
- No native_hint reveals or literally includes the correct answer.
