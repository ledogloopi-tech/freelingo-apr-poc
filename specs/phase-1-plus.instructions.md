# Phase 1+ — Learning Resources Hub

## Objective

A unified resource centre delivering five complementary features: a grammar reference, vocabulary explorer, situational phrasebook, skills tracker with competency monitoring, and end-of-level completion tests. All reference content is static TypeScript — no database, no API calls needed for content browsing. The hub is tightly integrated with the curriculum roadmap, lessons, flashcards, and the AI tutor.

## Milestone 1 — Grammar Reference

### Data model (`frontend/src/data/grammar.ts`)

A single static TypeScript file containing approximately 50+ grammar topics spanning A1 through C2. No backend endpoint needed — all content ships with the JS bundle and is tree-shakeable.

Each grammar topic has:

- **`slug`** — Type: string. Description: URL-safe identifier (e.g. `"present-simple"`, `"past-continuous"`)
- **`title`** — Type: string. Description: Display title
- **`level`** — Type: CEFRLevel. Description: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2
- **`category`** — Type: GrammarCategory. Description: One of 14 categories (Tenses, Questions, Nouns, Pronouns, Adjectives & Adverbs, Modals, Conditionals, Passive Voice, Reported Speech, Clauses, Articles, Prepositions, Phrasal Verbs, Advanced)
- **`summary`** — Type: string. Description: One-line description for index cards
- **`explanation`** — Type: string. Description: Full explanation in Markdown-lite format
- **`structure`** — Type: string (optional). Description: Formula/pattern (e.g. "Subject + base verb + s/es")
- **`rules`** — Type: string[]. Description: Key rules as bullet points
- **`examples`** — Type: array. Description: Objects with `english`, optional `translation` (rendered in user's native language), and optional `note`
- **`common_mistakes`** — Type: array. Description: Objects with `wrong`, `correct`, and `note` fields
- **`related`** — Type: string[]. Description: Slugs of related grammar topics for cross-linking

**Categories**: 14 categories provide structure for the index page, allowing users to filter by grammatical category in addition to CEFR level.

### Grammar index page (`/grammar`)

Renders all grammar topics organized by CEFR level. Each topic appears as a card showing:

- Title and category badge
- Summary paragraph
- "View details →" link

Features a search bar that filters topics by title and content. Category filter tabs allow narrowing by grammatical category.

### Grammar detail page (`/grammar/[slug]`)

Dynamic route rendering a single grammar topic. The `[slug]` parameter maps directly to a `GrammarTopic.slug`:

- Unknown slugs return a 404 page (Next.js `notFound()`)
- Renders: title, level badge, explanation (formatted Markdown-lite), structure pattern, rules list, example sentences with optional translations, common mistakes table, and related topics links
- Related topics are linked to their own detail pages
- The AI tutor's system prompt references the current grammar slug to provide contextual corrections during chat

### Integration with other features

- **Lessons**: lesson content includes `grammar_refs` — slugs from this data file for cross-linking
- **Assessment**: quiz questions have optional `grammar_slug` to map wrong answers to grammar topics
- **Curriculum**: each `CurriculumUnit` declares `grammar_points` — the set of slugs covered
- **Level test**: questions are constrained to grammar slugs studied during the level
- **Validation**: the backend validates that LLM-generated grammar slugs belong to a known set of 24 slugs (`VALID_GRAMMAR_SLUGS`)

---

## Milestone 2 — Vocabulary Hub

### Data model (`backend/app/data/_types.py` + per-language `vocabulary.py`)

> **Migrated to backend in v1.7.4.** Originally static TypeScript (`frontend/src/data/vocabulary.ts`); now served via `GET /api/vocabulary` from Python dataclasses organized per CEFR level (A1–C2) across backend language modules, including Japanese (`ja-JP`), Korean (`ko-KR`), and Mainland Chinese (`zh-CN`). The CJK language packages follow the same per-level module and assembler organization as the other backend language packages. The frontend vocabulary hub and set detail pages consume the API instead of importing static data.

**VocabularyEntry** (per word):

| Field            | Type              | Description                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `word`           | string            | English word                                                                      |
| `pos`            | PartOfSpeech      | Noun, verb, adjective, adverb, phrase, conjunction, preposition, numeral, pronoun |
| `definition`     | string            | Simple English definition                                                         |
| `example`        | string            | Natural usage example                                                             |
| `ipa`            | string (optional) | IPA pronunciation                                                                 |
| `frequency_rank` | number (optional) | Usage frequency ranking                                                           |

**VocabularySet** (per topic):

| Field      | Type              | Description                                              |
| ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`       | string            | Unique identifier (e.g. `"identity"`, `"greetings"`)     |
| `level`    | CEFRLevel         | CEFR level                                               |
| `topic`    | string            | Human-readable topic name                                |
| `unit_ref` | string            | Curriculum unit this set belongs to (e.g. `"a1-unit-1"`) |
| `words`    | VocabularyEntry[] | The vocabulary items                                     |

### Vocabulary index page (`/vocabulary`)

Lists all vocabulary sets grouped by CEFR level. Each set card shows:

- Topic name and level badge
- Word count (e.g. "15 words")
- Flashcard progress: how many words from this set the user has as flashcards ("3/15 in flashcards")

Search bar filters sets by topic name or words within.

### Vocabulary set detail page (`/vocabulary/[setId]`)

Dynamic route for a single vocabulary set. The `[setId]` parameter maps to a `VocabularySet.id`. Shows:

- Topic title, level badge, word count
- Full word table: word, part of speech badge, definition, example, IPA pronunciation, frequency rank
- "Add to flashcards" button: sends the word to the flashcards API for SM-2 review

### Integration with flashcards

The vocabulary hub and flashcard system are connected:

- Users can add individual words or whole sets to their flashcards
- The progress page shows per-set flashcard coverage
- When the LLM generates flashcards, it can draw from the user's current vocabulary set

---

## Milestone 3 — Phrasebook

### Data model (`backend/app/data/_types.py` + per-language `phrasebook.py`)

> **Migrated to backend.** Phrasebook content is served via `GET /api/phrasebook` from Python dataclasses organized per CEFR level (A1-C2) across backend language modules, including Japanese (`ja-JP`), Korean (`ko-KR`), and Mainland Chinese (`zh-CN`). Japanese, Korean, and Mainland Chinese phrasebooks each contain 318 target-language phrases across A1-C2.

**Phrase** (per entry):

| Field      | Type              | Description                              |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `text`     | string            | The phrase in the target language        |
| `context`  | string            | When/where to use the phrase             |
| `register` | Register          | `"formal"`, `"neutral"`, or `"informal"` |
| `unit_ref` | string (optional) | Curriculum unit this phrase relates to   |

**PhrasebookCategory** (per situation):

| Field       | Type      | Description                                            |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`        | string    | Unique identifier                                      |
| `level`     | CEFRLevel | Minimum level for this situation                       |
| `situation` | string    | Real-world scenario (e.g. "At the restaurant")         |
| `icon`      | string    | Emoji representing the situation (for visual indexing) |
| `phrases`   | Phrase[]  | The phrases for this situation                         |

### Phrasebook page (`/phrasebook`)

Lists all phrasebook categories. Filterable by:

- **CEFR level**: checkboxes or tabs for A1, A2, B1, B2, C1
- **Register**: formal, neutral, informal

Each category card shows:

- Icon (emoji) and situation name
- Level badge
- Phrase count
- Expand to see all phrases with context and register badges
- Phrase entries are selectable (tap to copy to clipboard)

### Usage

The phrasebook is designed as a quick reference for real-world English. It complements the grammar and vocabulary references by focusing on complete, usable expressions rather than isolated words or rules.

---

## Milestone 4 — Skills Tracker

### Progress page (`/progress`)

A comprehensive skills dashboard replacing the simpler progress summary. Shows three main sections:

**Unit Competency Checklist**

Per-unit progress derived from `UserCompetency` records (Phase 1+ backend model). Each unit displays:

- Unit name and CEFR level
- List of competencies with individual scores (0.0–1.0) and mastery status (>= 0.80)
- Overall unit percentage (average of competency scores)
- Progress bar with color coding: red (< 0.40), yellow (0.40–0.79), green (>= 0.80)

Competencies are updated via exponential moving average each time a related lesson is completed. The EMA formula: `new_score = (0.7 × previous_score) + (0.3 × latest_score)`.

**Vocabulary Progress**

Per-set vocabulary progress:

- Which vocabulary sets have been added to flashcards
- How many words from each set are in the user's flashcard deck
- Progress bars showing coverage per set

**XP and Streak History**

- Current streak (consecutive active days)
- Total XP
- Daily XP breakdown (last 90 days)
- Skill scores: grammar, vocabulary, reading, writing (also EMA-based)

### Backend endpoint

`GET /api/progress/competencies` — returns per-unit competency data from `user_competencies` table, aggregated by unit and ordered by curriculum sequence.

---

## Milestone 5 — Level Completion Test

### Purpose

When a user completes all curriculum units in their current CEFR level, an end-of-level test becomes available. This test evaluates whether the student has truly mastered the level's content before advancing.

### Trigger

- The `LevelTestBanner` component appears on the dashboard when `current_unit` surpasses the last unit of the level
- The `/plan` roadmap shows a gold "Level Test" node at the end of the timeline
- Both are only clickable after ALL units in the level are completed

### Question generation

Test questions are generated by the LLM (backend) and constrained to:

- Grammar points studied during the level (from the curriculum unit's `grammar_points`)
- Vocabulary sets studied during the level (from `vocabulary_set_ids`)
- 20 questions total, mixing grammar, vocabulary, and reading comprehension
- No content from the next CEFR level

The prompt (`END_OF_LEVEL_TEST_PROMPT` in `services/assessment.py`) instructs the LLM to generate questions using the same schema as the placement test but strictly scoped to studied material.

### Scoring and recommendations

| Score       | Recommendation | Action                                            |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| >= 0.75     | `"advance"`    | Unlock next CEFR level, create new study plan     |
| 0.55 – 0.74 | `"extend"`     | Recommend 4-week extension focusing on weak units |
| < 0.55      | `"repeat"`     | Recommend repeating the full level                |

The recommendation is stored in the StudyPlan model (`completion_test_score`, `completion_test_recommendation`) and displayed in the `TestResultSummary` component.

### User flow

```
Dashboard → LevelTestBanner ("You've completed all A1 units!")
    ↓
/assessment/level-test → 20 questions (LLM-generated, curriculum-constrained)
    ↓
Submission → Backend scores → returns result + recommendation
    ↓
TestResultSummary: score, competency breakdown, recommendation
    ↓
If "advance": unlock next level plan creation
If "extend": extend current plan by 4 weeks, focus on weak units
If "repeat": archive current plan, enable creating a new plan for same level
```

---

## Milestone 6 — Navigation & Routing

### Sidebar navigation

The sidebar nav groups routes under logical sections:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ 📊 LEARNING          │
│   Dashboard          │
│   Study Plan         │
│   Progress           │
│                      │
│ 📚 RESOURCES         │
│   Grammar            │
│   Vocabulary         │
│   Phrasebook         │
│                      │
│ 🎯 PRACTICE          │
│   Lessons            │
│   Flashcards         │
│   Chat with Tutor    │
│   Conversation       │
│                      │
│ ⚙️ SETTINGS          │
│   Settings           │
│   FAQ                │
│   Admin Panel        │ ← admin only
└─────────────────────┘
```

The RESOURCES nav group was added in Phase 1+ to give grammar, vocabulary, and phrasebook prominent placement.

### Mobile navigation

On mobile (below `md` breakpoint), the sidebar collapses into a hamburger menu. The chat sidebar (conversation list) opens as a fixed overlay with a semi-transparent backdrop rather than a side-by-side column.

### Route protection

Next.js middleware at `src/middleware.ts`:

- Detects `refresh_token` cookie for auth gating
- Redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
- Handles locale detection via `next-intl` (cookie-based, falls back to Accept-Language header)
- Matcher excludes static assets, `_next`, and API routes

---

## Technical design decisions

### Static reference content

Grammar, vocabulary, phrasebook, and assessment reference content is served from backend Python dataclasses via API endpoints (`/api/grammar`, `/api/vocabulary`, `/api/phrasebook`, `/api/assessment/bank`). Curriculum data (unit definitions, grammar points, vocabulary set IDs) lives in backend Python files for plan generation and in frontend data/API consumers for roadmap rendering.

Reasons for the current approach:

1. **Reference data (backend API)**: large multi-language datasets benefit from server-side serving, per-language dispatching, and shared integrity checks without bloating the client bundle
2. **Curriculum (backend + frontend consumers)**: backend data drives plan generation and lesson constraints; frontend surfaces fetch/render the current curriculum state for the roadmap UI

### Cross-referencing

A data integrity test (`test_frontend_data_integrity.py`) validates that:

- Every `grammar_slug` referenced in curriculum units exists in the target language's backend grammar data
- Every `vocabulary_set_id` referenced in each language's curriculum exists in that language's backend vocabulary data, including Japanese, Korean, and Mainland Chinese
- Every `related` slug in grammar topics points to an existing topic

### Curriculum data flow

Curriculum state is exposed to both backend and frontend:

- `frontend/src/data/curriculum.ts` and curriculum API consumers — roadmap UI rendering
- `backend/app/data/curriculum.py` and language packages — canonical curriculum data for plan generation and lesson constraints

This split is intentional: the frontend needs fast roadmap rendering, and the backend needs authoritative curriculum data for plan generation and LLM constraint validation. Cross-file references are validated by data integrity tests.
