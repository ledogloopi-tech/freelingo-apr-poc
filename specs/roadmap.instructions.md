**Completion criteria:**
- [x] `GET /api/listening/next` returns an uncompleted exercise for the user's level, or `{ "available": false }`

## Phase 7 — Reading

✅ Status: Complete (v1.5.3)

> LLM-generated reading comprehension exercises. Text is shown immediately alongside 5
> multiple-choice questions (no audio, no "I'm ready" gate). Exercises are cached per
> CEFR level and target language so multiple users share the same content. Score and XP
> are awarded on submission; completed exercises move to a personal history tab where
> they can be replayed without earning additional XP.

| # | Milestone | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | DB models — `reading_exercises` + `reading_attempts` + migration `0019` | ✅ |
| 2 | Backend service — LLM generation (no TTS), 7 exercise types, 6 topic sets, Redis generation lock | ✅ |

| 6 | Two-column layout (passage 55% / questions 45%) on desktop; stacked on mobile | ✅ |
| 7 | Sidebar nav entry (immediately after Listening) | ✅ |
| 8 | i18n — `nav.reading` + `reading.*` namespace in all 10 locale files | ✅ |
| 9 | `PaywallGate` on AI endpoints; history accessible without subscription | ✅ |
| 10 | Answer count validation (`field_validator` — exactly 5 answers required) | ✅ |

**Completion criteria:**
- [x] `GET /api/reading/next` returns exercise with `text` included immediately, or `{ "available": false }`
- [x] `POST /api/reading/generate` enqueues background LLM task; Redis lock prevents duplicate generation

- [x] `correct` field omitted from `QuestionOut`; only revealed after `POST /attempt`
- [x] Completed exercises excluded from "new" pool; accessible via history

- [x] Score 0–5, XP 0–50 (10 per correct answer) saved correctly
- [x] History paginated (`skip` / `limit`, max 50); returns `total` count
- [x] Paywall returns 403 on AI endpoints when `STRIPE_ENABLED=true` and user is unsubscribed
- [x] `POST /attempt` with ≠ 5 answers returns 422 (Pydantic `field_validator`)

| 5 | Vote toggle inline on list cards and in detail view | ✅ |
| 6 | Flat comment thread in detail view with add/delete | ✅ |
| 7 | i18n — `feedback.*` namespace in all 10 locale files | ✅ |

## Phase 9 — LLM Memory

✅ Status: Complete (v1.6.0)

> The AI tutor autonomously remembers important details about the student (preferences,
> hobbies, profession, learning goals, struggles) as they emerge during chat or voice
> conversations. The LLM appends a structured marker block to its response when it
> decides something is worth persisting; the backend strips the block before the student
> sees it and saves the facts to the `memories` table. Saved memories are injected back
> into the system prompt for both chat and voice sessions, giving the tutor persistent
> cross-session context at zero extra LLM cost.

| # | Milestone | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | DB model — `memories` table + migration `0022_memory` | ✅ |
| 2 | `memory_service.py` — parse/strip marker, build context, save (dedup + FIFO eviction), get, delete, clear | ✅ |
| 3 | Chat integration — marker withheld mid-stream, `{"memory_updated": true}` SSE signal after `done` | ✅ |
| 4 | Voice integration — marker stripped from TTS path, `{"type": "memory_updated"}` WebSocket signal before `turn_complete` | ✅ |
| 5 | `MEMORY_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` injected into both chat and voice system prompts | ✅ |
| 6 | REST API — 3 endpoints: list, delete single, clear all (all require `require_subscription`) | ✅ |
| 7 | Frontend toast in chat and voice conversation on `memory_updated` signal | ✅ |
| 8 | Settings → Memory subpage (`/settings/memories`) — full list, individual delete, clear all | ✅ |
| 9 | i18n — `settings.sectionMemory`, `settings.memoryEmpty`, `settings.memoryClearAll*`, `chat.memoryUpdated`, `conversation.memoryUpdated` in all 10 locale files | ✅ |
| 10 | Tests — `test_memories.py` with 18 test cases (unit + integration, IDOR guard, dedup, eviction, subscription gate) | ✅ |

**Completion criteria:**
- [x] LLM marker `<<MEMORY>>…<<ENDMEMORY>>` never reaches the frontend (stripped in both chat SSE and voice WebSocket)
- [x] New memories saved after each turn that contains the marker block
- [x] Exact-duplicate items skipped; FIFO eviction when `MAX_MEMORIES_PER_USER` (50) is exceeded
- [x] Up to `MAX_MEMORIES_CONTEXT` (20) most recent memories injected into system prompt per request
- [x] `GET /api/memories` returns all memories oldest-first
- [x] `DELETE /api/memories/{id}` returns 404 if wrong owner (IDOR guard)
- [x] `DELETE /api/memories` returns `{"deleted": N}`
- [x] Toast notification appears in chat and voice when new memories are saved
- [x] `/settings/memories` subpage lists all memories with individual delete and clear-all
- [x] `tsc --noEmit` and `python3 -m compileall` pass clean
- [x] No regressions in Phases 1–8
