**Completion criteria:**

- [x] `GET /api/feedback` filters by `type`, `status`, `sort`, `order`, `skip`, `limit` correctly
- [x] `POST /api/feedback` creates entry with status `pending`; returns 201
- [x] Vote toggle increments/decrements `vote_count` atomically; only feature entries accept votes
- [x] Bug entries return 400 on vote attempt
- [x] `UNIQUE(entry_id, user_id)` constraint enforced — no duplicate votes
- [x] Admin can update status to any of: `pending`, `planned`, `in_progress`, `done`, `declined`
- [x] Author or admin can delete an entry; cascade removes all votes and comments
- [x] Author or admin can delete a comment
- [x] `voted_by_me` and `comment_count` correctly populated per authenticated user
- [x] `tsc --noEmit` and `python3 -m compileall` pass clean
- [x] No regressions in Phases 1–7

## Phase 9 — LLM Memory

✅ Status: Complete (v1.6.0)

> The AI tutor autonomously remembers important details about the student (preferences,
> hobbies, profession, learning goals, struggles) as they emerge during chat or voice
> conversations. The LLM appends a structured marker block to its response when it
> decides something is worth persisting; the backend strips the block before the student
> sees it and saves the facts to the `memories` table. Saved memories are injected back
> into the system prompt for both chat and voice sessions, giving the tutor persistent
> cross-session context at zero extra LLM cost.

- **1** — DB model — `memories` table + migration `0022_memory`. Status: ✅
- **2** — `memory_service.py` — parse/strip marker, build context, save (dedup + FIFO eviction), get, delete, clear. Status: ✅
- **3** — Chat integration — marker withheld mid-stream, `{"memory_updated": true}` SSE signal after `done`. Status: ✅
- **4** — Voice integration — marker stripped from TTS path, `{"type": "memory_updated"}` WebSocket signal before `turn_complete`. Status: ✅
- **5** — `MEMORY_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` injected into both chat and voice system prompts. Status: ✅
- **6** — REST API — 3 endpoints: list, delete single, clear all (all require `require_subscription`; maintenance mode is not applied). Status: ✅
- **7** — Frontend toast in chat and voice conversation on `memory_updated` signal. Status: ✅
- **8** — Settings → Memory subpage (`/settings/memories`) — full list, individual delete, clear all. Status: ✅
- **9** — i18n — `settings.sectionMemory`, `settings.memoryEmpty`, `settings.memoryClearAll*`, `chat.memoryUpdated`, `conversation.memoryUpdated` in all 10 locale files. Status: ✅
- **10** — Tests — `test_memories.py` with 18 test cases (unit + integration, IDOR guard, dedup, eviction, subscription gate). Status: ✅

**Completion criteria:**

- [x] LLM marker `<<MEMORY>>...<<ENDMEMORY>>` never reaches the frontend (stripped in both chat SSE and voice WebSocket)
- [x] New memories saved after each turn that contains the marker block
- [x] Exact-duplicate items skipped; FIFO eviction when `MAX_MEMORIES_PER_USER` (50) is exceeded
- [x] Up to `MAX_MEMORIES_CONTEXT` (20) most recent memories injected into system prompt per request
- [x] `GET /api/memories` returns all memories oldest-first
- [x] `DELETE /api/memories/{id}` returns 404 if wrong owner (IDOR guard)
- [x] `DELETE /api/memories` returns `{"deleted": N}`
- [x] Toast notification appears in chat and voice when new memories are saved
- [x] `/settings/memories` subpage lists all memories with individual delete and clear-all
- [x] `tsc --noEmit` and `python3 -m compileall` pass clean
- [x] No regressions in Phases 1–8

## Phase 10 — Multi-Language Support (Multiple Simultaneous Languages)

✅ Status: Complete (v1.7.0)

> Each user can learn multiple languages simultaneously. Every language gets its own
> isolated study plan, progress, flashcards, conversations, memories, and competencies.
> A sidebar language switcher lets the user pivot the entire experience to any of their
> active plans with one click. Phase 4 added `target_language` as a single value per
> user — Phase 10 extends it to a full per-language data model.
>
> See [`phase-10-multi-language.instructions.md`](phase-10-multi-language.instructions.md) for the sub-phase index and full spec.

- \***\*10.1\*\*** — Title: Database: `user_languages` table, `study_plan_id` columns, partial unique index, Alembic migration `0029`, conftest fixtures, isolation tests. Status: ✅
- \***\*10.2\*\*** — Title: Backend: `user_language_service`, `get_active_study_plan` dependency, multi-language LLM prompts, migration `0030` (placeholder — NOT NULL moved to 10.3); prompt tests. Status: ✅
- \***\*10.3\*\*** — Title: API: new `/api/languages` router, refactor assessment + study-plan endpoints, Pydantic schemas; backend tests. Status: ✅
- \***\*10.4\*\*** — Title: Frontend core: `target-languages.ts` config, language Zustand store, `LanguageSwitcher` component, sidebar integration. Status: ✅
- \***\*10.5\*\*** — Title: Frontend pages: Settings → My Languages, onboarding flow, dashboard, plan, chat, flashcards, progress adapted; i18n keys added per sub-phase; frontend tests. Status: ✅
- \***\*10.6\*\*** — Title: Curriculum and language data: Spanish, Italian, Portuguese curriculum files (backend + frontend); target language descriptions; curriculum tests. Status: ✅

**Completion criteria:**

- [x] A user can add a second language from Settings → My Languages
- [x] Language switcher appears in sidebar only when the user has ≥ 2 languages
- [x] Switching language pivots the entire experience (plan, flashcards, chat, progress) to that language's plan
- [x] Flashcards, progress, memories, and competencies are fully isolated per `study_plan_id`
- [x] Spanish (`es-ES`), Italian (`it-IT`), and Portuguese (`pt-PT`) curriculum data is complete and correct
- [x] All LLM prompts are language-agnostic (no hardcoded "English")
- [x] Migration `0029` runs cleanly; `downgrade` fully reverses it
- [x] Migration `0031` (NOT NULL on `progress`, `flashcards`, `user_competencies`) runs cleanly after 10.3 callers are deployed
- [x] Existing English-only users are unaffected after migration
- [x] `tsc --noEmit` and `python3 -m compileall` pass clean
- [x] No regressions in Phases 1–9

✅ Status: Complete (v1.8.9)

> One verified review per user, with mandatory 1–5 star rating, optional comment,
> active learning language snapshot, admin approval, and approved positive reviews
> displayed on the public landing page.
