# Study Plan & Lesson System — FreeLingo

> Phase specs (`phase-1-platform.instructions.md`, etc.) document the **history** of how features were built.  
> This file is the **authoritative current-state reference** for the plan and lesson domain.

---

## Overview

FreeLingo's learning loop works as follows:

1. User completes the CEFR assessment → `POST /api/assessment/complete` creates a `StudyPlan`.
2. The plan is a **deterministic week/day grid** derived from the static curriculum — no LLM at generation time.
3. Each day in the plan has one or more **lesson slots** (defined in `generated_plan`, stored as JSON).
4. When the user opens a day for the first time, lesson content is **generated on-demand by the LLM** and persisted to the DB.
5. The user's position in the plan is tracked by a single integer: `progress_day`.
6. Progress advances automatically when all lessons for the current day are marked complete, or manually via "skip day".
7. When completing a lesson moves the user into a different curriculum unit, the frontend may show the reusable review prompt, subject to duplicate-review checks and local dismissal cooldown.

## Data model

### `StudyPlan` (`study_plans` table)

One active plan per user. See `backend/app/models/study_plan.py`.

**`progress_day` semantics**

`progress_day` is a **0-indexed integer** representing the number of days the user has completed.

- `progress_day = 0` → user is on day 1 (no days complete yet).
- `progress_day = N` → N days complete; user is currently working on the day at absolute index N.
- `total_days = duration_weeks × days_per_week` → when `progress_day >= total_days` the plan is finished.

Mapping to week/day numbers:

```
current_week = (progress_day // days_per_week) + 1
current_day  = (progress_day %  days_per_week) + 1
```

Example (`days_per_week=4`):

| progress_day |   current_week    | current_day |
| :----------: | :---------------: | :---------: |
|      0       |         1         |      1      |
|      3       |         1         |      4      |
|      4       |         2         |      1      |
|      47      |        12         |      4      |
|      48      | — plan complete — |      —      |

### `Lesson` (`lessons` table)

One row per lesson slot per day. Lessons are created lazily the first time the user calls `GET /today`.

| Column        | Type                | Notes                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id            | integer             | Primary key                                                    |
| study_plan_id | integer             | FK → study_plans                                               |
| title         | string              | Lesson title (matches the slot title in `generated_plan`)      |
| lesson_type   | string              | `grammar` / `vocabulary` / `reading` / `writing` / `listening` / `review` |
| cefr_level    | string              |                                                                |
| week_number   | integer             | Week in the plan (1-based)                                     |
| day_number    | integer             | Day in the week (1-based)                                      |
| unit_id       | string (nullable)   | Curriculum unit this lesson belongs to                         |
| content       | JSON                | Full lesson content generated by LLM (explanation + exercises) |
| is_completed  | boolean             | Default false                                                  |
| completed_at  | datetime (nullable) | Set by `POST /lessons/{id}/complete`                           |

There is a **unique constraint** on `(study_plan_id, week_number, day_number, title)` to prevent duplicate generation under race conditions.

### `Exercise` (`exercises` table)

Exercises belong to a lesson (1:N). Generated alongside the lesson and stored in the DB.

| Column         | Type                | Notes                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id             | integer             | Primary key                                                       |
| lesson_id      | integer             | FK → lessons                                                      |
| exercise_type  | string              | `multiple_choice` / `fill_blank` / `free_write` / `pronunciation` |
| question       | text                |                                                                   |
| options        | JSON (nullable)     | Answer options for `multiple_choice`                              |
| correct_answer | text                |                                                                   |
| user_answer    | text (nullable)     | User's submitted answer                                           |
| score          | float (nullable)    | 0.0 – 1.0                                                         |
| feedback       | text (nullable)     | Evaluation feedback (LLM or deterministic)                        |
| answered_at    | datetime (nullable) | Set when the user submits an answer                               |

## Plan generation

**File:** `backend/app/services/study_plan_generator.py`

Plan generation is **fully deterministic** — no LLM call. The service:

1. Fetches curriculum units for the requested CEFR level from `backend/app/data/curriculum.py`.
2. Calls `distribute_units()` to spread units across the total weeks × days grid.
3. Builds a list of `WeekPlan` objects, each containing a list of `DayPlan` objects.
4. Returns a `GeneratedPlan` Pydantic model, which is stored as JSON in `study_plans.generated_plan`.

Current backend curriculum modules cover `en-GB`, `en-US`, `de-DE`, `es-ES`, `fr-FR`, `it-IT`, `pt-PT`, `ja-JP`, `ko-KR`, and `zh-CN`. Japanese plans use Japanese unit titles and templates such as `文字とあいさつ - レッスン 1`; Korean plans use Korean unit titles and templates such as `한글과 기본 인사 - 레슨 1`; Mainland Chinese plans use Simplified Chinese unit titles and templates such as `拼音、声调和问候 - 第 1 课`. Japanese, Korean, and Mainland Chinese curricula include `listening` lesson slots from A2 through C2, matching the platform's voice/listening practice model while keeping A1 focused on fundamentals.

### Plan JSON structure (`generated_plan`)

```jsonc
{
  "title": "English A1 — 12-week programme",
  "cefr_level": "A1",
  "duration_weeks": 12,
  "days_per_week": 4,
  "ends_with_test": true,
  "weekly_plan": [
    {
      "week": 1,
      "theme": "Greetings & introductions",
      "days": [
        {
          "day": 1,
          "lesson_type": "vocabulary",
          "title": "Basic greetings",
          "objectives": ["Use common greeting phrases"],
          "estimated_minutes": 20,
          "unit_id": "a1-unit-1",
          "grammar_points": ["present-simple"],
          "vocabulary_set_ids": ["greetings_a1"],
        },
        // ...
      ],
    },
    // ...
  ],
}
```

## Lesson generation (lazy, on-demand)

**File:** `backend/app/services/lesson_generator.py`

Lesson content is generated by the LLM **the first time a user accesses a day** via `GET /today`. The lesson is then persisted to the DB and reused on subsequent calls. The router uses a title-based lookup to avoid regenerating existing lessons.

The `generate_lesson()` function receives:

- `cefr_level`, `lesson_type`, `topic` (= lesson title)
- `week`, `day`, `unit_id`
- `grammar_points`, `vocabulary_set_ids` (from curriculum context)
- `target_language` (user's target language BCP-47)
- `native_language` for every lesson level, so lessons can include a native-language explanation alongside the target-language explanation.

It returns a structured JSON with:

- `explanation` — rich lesson content
- `native_explanation` — optional translated explanation using the user's native language, generated automatically for new lessons at any CEFR level or later via `POST /api/lessons/{id}/native-explanation` for existing lessons. It contains translated explanation text, key points, examples with target-language sentences, plus native-language `common_traps` and `mini_glossary` study support. The lesson UI opens it by default for A1/A2 and keeps it collapsed by default for B1+.
- `exercises` — list of exercise objects (`type`, `question`, `options`, `correct`, `explanation`, optional `native_explanation`). New generated exercises keep the exercise itself and target-language explanation in the target language, then add a concise native-language clarification shown below the target-language explanation in the lesson UI. The persisted `exercises` table remains unchanged; `GET /api/lessons/{id}` reads the optional native text from `lesson.content.exercises[*].native_explanation` and includes it in each exercise response when available. If an existing exercise has `explanation` but no `native_explanation`, the UI shows a native-language button that calls `POST /api/lessons/exercises/{id}/native-explanation`; the backend generates the clarification from the exercise fields, caches it back into `lesson.content.exercises[*].native_explanation`, and returns it to update local UI state.

If the LLM call fails or returns an empty exercises list, the lesson is discarded (rolled back) and that slot returns `id: null` in the today response. The user can retry by refreshing.

---

## Unit-completion review prompt

**File:** `frontend/src/app/(app)/lesson/[id]/page.tsx`

After `POST /api/lessons/{id}/complete`, the lesson page calls `GET /api/study-plan/today` to detect day advancement and the next available lesson. If the completed lesson has `content.unit_id` and the next available lesson belongs to a different `unit_id`, the frontend treats the previous unit as complete and may show the reusable review prompt. The same prompt may also appear if the plan is complete (`progress_day >= total_days`).

The prompt is not shown when the next `unit_id` is missing and the plan is not complete, which avoids asking for a review if the next lesson failed to generate. Duplicate-review prevention still happens through the review API (`GET /api/reviews/me`), and local dismissal cooldown is handled by `frontend/src/lib/review-prompt-triggers.ts` plus `freelingo:reviewPromptDismissed` in `localStorage`.

---

## `GET /api/study-plan/today` — full flow

**File:** `backend/app/routers/study_plan.py`

This is the central endpoint of the learning loop. On every call it:

1. **Loads the active plan** for the authenticated user (404 if none).
2. **Loads all existing lessons** for the plan in a single query.
3. **Builds an index** `lessons_by_wday: dict[(week, day), list[Lesson]]` for fast lookups.
4. **Auto-advance loop**: While `progress_day < total_days`:
   - Compute `(current_week, current_day)` from the current `progress_day`.
   - Get lessons for that day from the index.
   - If the day has lessons **and all are `is_completed=True`** → increment `progress_day`.
   - Otherwise → stop.
5. **Persists the new `progress_day`** with a single `commit()` if it changed.
6. **Computes `pending_count`**: count of `is_completed=False` lessons from days that have already been passed (`abs_day < progress_day`).
7. If `progress_day >= total_days` → returns empty lessons (plan complete).
8. **Looks up the current week/day** in `generated_plan.weekly_plan`.
9. For each lesson slot in the current day:
   - If a `Lesson` row with the same title already exists → uses its `id`.
   - If not → calls `generate_lesson()` (LLM) → persists Lesson + Exercises → stores `lesson_id`.
   - On `IntegrityError` (race condition) → rolls back → fetches the already-created row.
   - On any other exception → logs it → excludes the slot from today's response.
10. **Returns `TodayResponse`**:

```json
{
  "plan_id": 1,
  "cefr_level": "A1",
  "progress_day": 3,
  "total_days": 48,
  "pending_count": 1,
  "lessons": [
    {
      "id": 12,
      "title": "Basic greetings",
      "lesson_type": "vocabulary",
      "week": 1,
      "day": 4,
      "objectives": ["Use common greeting phrases"],
      "estimated_minutes": 20,
      "unit_id": "a1-unit-1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Important invariant

The auto-advance loop advances **only past days where every generated lesson is complete**. A day with no generated lessons (never accessed) will **not** be auto-advanced past. The user must either access those lessons and complete them, or use "skip day".

---

## `POST /api/study-plan/skip-day` — skip the current day

Increments `progress_day` by 1, capped at `total_days`. Does not affect existing lessons.

Returns:

```json
{ "progress_day": 4, "total_days": 48 }
```

Use case: the user wants to move on without completing today's lessons. The skipped lessons become **pending** (visible in `/pending-lessons` and `pending_count`).

---

## `GET /api/study-plan/pending-lessons` — incomplete past lessons

Returns a list of `Lesson` rows that:

- Belong to the active plan.
- Are **not** completed (`is_completed = false`).
- Are from days that have already been passed: `(week_number − 1) × days_per_week + (day_number − 1) < progress_day`.

Response shape (array):

```json
[
  {
    "id": 7,
    "title": "Basic greetings",
    "lesson_type": "vocabulary",
    "week_number": 1,
    "day_number": 1
  }
]
```

Only **generated** lessons appear here. Lesson slots that were never accessed (no DB row) are invisible to this endpoint. This is by design — you cannot be "pending" on content that was never loaded.

---

## Lesson lifecycle

```
slot in generated_plan
        │
        ▼  first GET /today call for this day
  generate_lesson() via LLM
        │
        ▼
  Lesson row created (is_completed=false)
  Exercise rows created
        │
        ▼  user opens lesson page
  GET /api/lessons/{id}   (lesson detail + exercises)
  POST /api/lessons/{id}/start
        │
        ▼  user completes exercises
  POST /api/lessons/exercises/{ex_id}/answer  (× N)
        │
        ▼  user taps "Complete lesson"
  POST /api/lessons/{id}/complete
  → is_completed = true, completed_at = now
  → update_daily_progress() (XP, streak, skill scores)
  → upsert_unit_competency() if lesson has unit_id
        │
        ▼  next GET /today call
  auto-advance checks if all lessons for the day are complete
  → if yes: progress_day += 1
```

---

## Frontend integration

### Dashboard (`frontend/src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`)

On load, calls `GET /api/progress/summary` and `GET /api/study-plan/today` in parallel.

From the today response it reads:

- `progress_day` / `total_days` → renders a progress bar and a "Day X of Y" label (`dayProgress` i18n key).  
  The label shows `Math.min(progress_day + 1, total_days)` as the current day number (1-based display of a 0-indexed value).
- `pending_count` → shows a "N pending lessons →" button linking to `/plan` when > 0.
- `lessons` → renders today's lesson cards with "Start" buttons.

The **"Skip today"** button is shown when `lessons.length > 0`. It calls `POST /api/study-plan/skip-day` then refreshes the page data.

The **assessment button** is shown only when the user has no active plan (`hasPlan = false`, i.e. the `/today` call returned 404).

### Lesson player (`frontend/src/app/(app)/lesson/[id]/page.tsx`)

On mount, stores the current `progress_day` (fetched from `GET /today`) in `progressDayAtStart`.

After `POST /lessons/{id}/complete` succeeds, calls `GET /today` again. If the returned `progress_day > progressDayAtStart`, it means the auto-advance fired — the day is complete. A **"Day complete"** banner is shown to the user.

---

## Database migrations

- **0025** — File: `0025_plan_progress_day.py`. Description: Adds `progress_day` column to `study_plans`. Backfills existing rows using `COALESCE(MAX((week_number-1)*days_per_week + (day_number-1)) + 1, 0)` from completed lessons. Sets `NOT NULL`.
