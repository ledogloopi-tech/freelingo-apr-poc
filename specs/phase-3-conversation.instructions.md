# Phase 3 — Real-Time Voice Conversation

## Objective

A real-time voice conversation mode where the user speaks naturally and the AI responds in audio with conversational latency (~800 ms–1.3 s end-to-end on GPU). No push-to-talk buttons — Voice Activity Detection (VAD) automatically detects when the user has finished speaking. The entire pipeline (STT → LLM → TTS) runs through a single WebSocket connection orchestrated by the backend.

## Frontend — ConversationMode

### Architecture

The `ConversationMode` component is dynamically imported with `ssr: false` (no server-side rendering) because it depends on browser-only APIs: `WebSocket`, `AudioContext`, `MediaRecorder`, and WebAssembly (for VAD).

### VAD (Voice Activity Detection)

- **Library**: `@ricky0123/vad-react` (React hooks for `@ricky0123/vad-web`)
- **Model**: Silero VAD v5 (ONNX)
- **Runtime**: onnxruntime-web **1.25.1 threaded WASM** (requires `SharedArrayBuffer`)
- **Detection**: `useMicVAD` hook with `onSpeechEnd` callback — fires automatically when the user stops speaking

**COOP/COEP headers**: Threaded WASM requires `SharedArrayBuffer`, which browsers only expose when the page has specific cross-origin isolation headers. The Next.js config adds:
- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`
- `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless`

These are set globally in `next.config.ts` via the `headers()` function.

**VAD model files**: ONNX WASM binaries (`.wasm`) and model files are copied from `node_modules` to `public/vad/` by the `copy-vad-models.js` postinstall script. The script runs automatically after `npm install` and is re-executed in the Docker builder stage to ensure files are present at build time.

### Audio processing

- `float32ToWav(samples, sampleRate)`: encodes Float32Array PCM audio (16kHz mono from VAD) to WAV ArrayBuffer format for STT ingestion
- `createAudioQueue(ctx)`: manages gapless audio playback using Web Audio API. Schedules consecutive `AudioBufferSourceNode`s using `ctx.currentTime` offsetting — each new chunk is scheduled to start exactly when the previous one ends, eliminating gaps between TTS sentences

### Barge-in support

If the user starts speaking while the AI is still generating/playing a response:
1. VAD detects new speech → fires `onSpeechEnd`
2. Frontend sends new audio chunks to WebSocket
3. Backend detects new audio input → cancels current LLM streaming → cancels pending TTS sentences → sends `barge_in` message to frontend
4. Frontend `AudioQueue.cancel()` stops all pending audio playback
5. Pipeline restarts with new user input

### Transcript bubbles

Each turn (user speech and AI response) is rendered as a `TranscriptBubble` in a scrollable list. Shows:
- Role label ("You" / "AI Tutor")
- Spoken/preview text (streaming indicator while AI is generating)
- Bubbles are color-coded: user (accent) / AI (muted background)

### Session timeout UI

Two timeout mechanisms with visual warnings:
- **Max duration**: total session length (default 30 min), configurable per user
- **Inactivity**: silent period before disconnect (default 3 min), configurable per user

At T-60 seconds, a `SessionTimeoutBanner` appears with a countdown. When the timeout fires, the WebSocket sends a `session_end` message and disconnects.

---

## Backend — WebSocket endpoint

### Connection (`/ws/conversation`)

- **Protocol**: WebSocket
- **Auth**: After the WebSocket handshake is accepted, the client sends a JSON message `{"type": "auth", "token": "<access_token>"}` within 10 seconds. Sending the token in the URL is intentionally avoided to prevent it from appearing in server access logs.
- **Guard**: rejects connection with code 1008 if the auth message is missing/invalid, or with code 1011 if `TTS_ENABLED=false` or `STT_ENABLED=false`
- **Database**: uses an async session context manager for the user lookup (reads `conversation_max_duration` and `conversation_inactivity_timeout` from User model)

### Message types

| Direction | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Client → Server | binary | WAV audio frame (float32 PCM, 16kHz mono) |
| Server → Client | `transcript` | User's speech transcribed to text |
| Server → Client | `assistant_text` | Streaming AI response text (for display) |
| Server → Client | binary | MP3 audio chunk (one sentence of TTS) |
| Server → Client | `barge_in` | Current response cancelled, new input being processed |
| Server → Client | `session_warning` | Timeout warning (60 s remaining) |
| Server → Client | `session_end` | Session terminated by timeout |
| Server → Client | `error` | Pipeline error with message |

---

## Pipeline implementation (`app/services/conversation_pipeline.py`)

### Initialization

On WebSocket connect:
1. Decode JWT, fetch user from DB
2. Read user's `conversation_max_duration` and `conversation_inactivity_timeout` from the User model
3. Build system prompt with conversation partner persona (same CEFR-aware, no-emoji rule as chat tutor)
4. Start timeout watchers

### Main loop

1. **Receive audio**: read binary frame from WebSocket, reset inactivity timer
2. **STT**: send WAV bytes to STT service → get transcribed text
3. **Barge-in check**: if there's an active LLM/TTS generation, cancel it
4. **Context building**: prepend system prompt + last 20 messages (in-memory, not persisted)
5. **LLM streaming**: stream response from LLM adapter
6. **Sentence splitting**: accumulate characters into a buffer (max 150 chars). On sentence end detection (period, question mark, exclamation mark followed by space/end), flush the completed sentence to TTS
7. **TTS per sentence**: send each sentence to Kokoro → send MP3 binary to client
8. **Loop**: continue streaming until LLM response ends or barge-in occurs
9. **Send transcript**: send the complete AI text as `assistant_text` for the transcript display
10. **Append to history**: store the user+assistant exchange in the in-memory buffer (limited to 20 messages)

### Sentence boundary detection

A regex pattern (`SENTENCE_END`) identifies sentence boundaries in the streaming LLM output. Sentences are accumulated character-by-character and flushed when a boundary marker is encountered:
- Period (`.`), question mark (`?`), exclamation mark (`!`)
- Followed by whitespace or end-of-string
- Buffer limit: 150 characters (prevents excessively long sentences from delaying audio)

### Timeout watchers

Two asyncio tasks run concurrently with the main pipeline loop:

| Timer | Default | User-configurable | Warning |
|-------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Max duration | 1800 s (30 min) | `conversation_max_duration` (from user table) | 60 s warning via `session_warning` message |
| Inactivity | 180 s (3 min) | `conversation_inactivity_timeout` (from user table) | 60 s warning via `session_warning` message |

The inactivity timer resets on each received audio chunk. When either timeout fires, a `session_end` message is sent and the WebSocket connection is closed cleanly.

### Structured logging

Pipeline events are logged with structured prefixes:
- `[conversation]` — connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, auth errors)
- `[pipeline]` — flow events (STT completed, sentence flush, barge-in, timeout)
- `[stt]` — STT request/response details

Log level is controlled by the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable (default `INFO`). Set to `DEBUG` for detailed pipeline tracing.

### Error handling

- `RuntimeError` from `ws.receive()` on client disconnect: caught and handled gracefully (no crash)
- STT failures: send error message to client, do not disconnect
- LLM failures: send error message, continue loop
- TTS failures: send error message, skip the sentence
- Total STT → response latency target: < 2 s on GPU, < 4 s on CPU

### Conversation history

Voice conversations are **persisted incrementally** to the same `chat_history` table used by text chats. Each user utterance (STT result) and each completed assistant response is saved via `asyncio.create_task` as a `ChatHistory` row linked to a `Conversation` record with `source='voice'`. This makes voice sessions visible and reviewable in the tutor chat sidebar alongside text conversations — users can click a past voice session to read the full transcript, or continue it in voice mode.

---

## Configuration per user

Users configure their voice conversation preferences from `/settings`:

| Setting | Default | Range | Purpose |
|---------|---------|-------|---------|
| Conversation max duration | 30 min | 1–60 min | Total session length |
| Conversation inactivity timeout | 3 min | 1–10 min | Silence before auto-disconnect |

Settings are stored in the User model (`conversation_max_duration`, `conversation_inactivity_timeout` columns) and updatable via `PATCH /api/auth/me`. The WebSocket reads them on each new connection.

## Frontend dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `@ricky0123/vad-react` | ^0.0.36 | React hooks for VAD (wraps vad-web) |
| `@ricky0123/vad-web` | ^0.0.30 | VAD WebAssembly engine (Silero VAD v5 ONNX) |
| `onnxruntime-web` | 1.25.1 (threaded WASM) | ONNX model runtime for VAD |
| Web Audio API | Browser built-in | Gapless audio playback via AudioContext |
| MediaRecorder API | Browser built-in | Microphone stream capture |

## Deployment notes

- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`**: passed as Docker build ARG and baked at `next build` so the WebSocket URL resolves correctly, even on separate-subdomain deployments
- **CI/CD**: the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` secret is wired into the GitHub Actions `docker-publish.yml` frontend build step
- **VAD models in Docker**: the `copy-vad-models.js` postinstall script is re-executed in the Docker builder stage after `COPY frontend/` to ensure `.wasm` and `.mjs` files are present in the build output
